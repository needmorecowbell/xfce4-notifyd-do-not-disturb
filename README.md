# xfce4-notifyd-do-not-disturb


xfce4 Genmon plugin to handle toggling xfce4-notifyd's do-not-disturb flag
### Notice

This repo is meant to be tailored to your configuration, most commands are custom to my machine.

This will cause your audio notifications to stop as well. The key event listeners still work, but the notification will no longer appear on your screen.

### Requirements
- genmon
- xfce
- xconf-query
- python3

### Toggling

Click the icon to toggle, or use the commands `do_not_disturb`, `disturb_me`, and `do_not_disturb_toggle`
